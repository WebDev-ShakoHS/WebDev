                        <p>

                                As stated above, my name is Shawn Walsh and I am just like anyone else and I simply just play video games and it is my main hobby and source of entertainment. When I have free time, 90% will be playing video games or doing something with computers. Because of my love for video games and computers overall, I am taking many computer classes to learn about coding, solving errors, and many other similar things.

                        <h3>Why did I decide to make this site?</h3>
                        <p>

                                (Totally not for a class) I made this website to help others learn about video games and try to help people get a general understanding of them and help people find games they may enjoy.
