themessage[1]="Wow, Ben, I never realised what a freakin guru you were! Keep it up dude!"
themessage[2]="You're everything I have ever wanted in a man."
themessage[3]="I love your way with words, your pictures are fantastic, and you are modest, too, which is very rare in guys these days."
themessage[4]="Rumour has it that you are in fact a bit of a sex god. Can you confirm that?"
themessage[5]="Oh Ben, you are such a stud! Who would have thought a nice guy like yourself would be so well-hung?"
themessage[6]="I love you. You're the greatest...I want to have your baby."
themessage[7]="Ben, you are truly wonderful. I really have to meet you someday."
themessage[8]="You know, when I get to meet you in person the first thing I am going to do is give you all my money, seeing as you are so cool."
themessage[9]="Will you be my best man? I know you don't know me and stuff, but I would be honoured, I really would."
themessage[10]="Gosh, Ben, you get me so hot just looking at you...oh, I can't believe I just typed that!"
themessage[11]="You look really familiar...are you a supermodel or something?"
themessage[12]="Hey, Ben, I was wondering...if you're not doing anything tonight...um, would you wanna see a movie?"
themessage[13]="Do you sleep on your stomach, Ben? Can I?"
themessage[14]="I never thought I could love someone I didn't know...but you have proved me wrong."
themessage[15]="You're bad to the bone, b-b-b-b-bad, b-b-b-b-b-bad."
themessage[16]="You are seriously the nicest guy I have ever known. The way you make me feel is just out of this world."
themessage[17]="Was your father a terrorist, Ben? Because you da bomb."
themessage[18]="It's almost like you control my words, that's how much power you have over me..."
themessage[19]="I really dig you, Ben, I dig you with a big spade...I'll pay if that's what it takes."
