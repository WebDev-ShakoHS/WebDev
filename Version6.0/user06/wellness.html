                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Consistent Sleep Schedule:</strong> Go to bed and wake up at the same time every day, even on weekends. Consistency reinforces your body's natural sleep-wake cycle.</li>
                                <li><strong>Create a Relaxing Bedtime Ritual:</strong> Develop calming pre-sleep activities such as reading, gentle stretching, or listening to soothing music to signal your body that it's time to wind down.</li>
                                <li><strong>Limit Screen Time:</strong> Minimize exposure to screens (phones, computers, TVs) at least an hour before bedtime. The blue light emitted can disrupt your sleep-wake cycle.</li>
                                <li><strong>Optimize Your Sleep Environment:</strong> Keep your bedroom cool, dark, and quiet. Invest in a comfortable mattress and pillows to enhance overall comfort.</li>
                                <li><strong>Avoid Stimulants Before Bed:</strong> Limit caffeine and nicotine intake in the hours leading up to bedtime. These substances can interfere with your ability to fall asleep.</li>
                                <li><strong>Regular Exercise:</strong> Engage in regular physical activity, but try to finish exercising at least a few hours before bedtime to allow your body to wind down.</li>
                                <li><strong>Manage Stress:</strong> Practice stress-reducing techniques, such as deep breathing or meditation, to calm the mind before bedtime.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>By incorporating these sleep hygiene tips into your routine, you can promote better sleep and wake up feeling refreshed each morning.</p>
