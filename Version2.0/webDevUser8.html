			<p>
				This website is about the difference between someone observing the universe, and the universe existing on its own without observation
			</p>
			<p> 
				Here's the main point: existence doesn't rely on observation. An event can happen independently of whether someone or something observes it or not. The universe existed for millions of billions of years without individuals observing what happened, therefore existence exists as a first and observation as a second.
