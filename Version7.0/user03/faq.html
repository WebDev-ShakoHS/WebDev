        <dt>Are Creepy Clowns actually dangerous?</dt>
        <dd>Despite their frightening appearance, creepy clowns are no less dangerous than any other clowns. In fact, creepy clowns were originally bred to protect young children! So long as a creepy clown is properly socialized, it can be just as friendly as a golden retriever!</dd>
        <dt>What should you do if you get too close to a wild Harlequin?</dt>
        <dd>DO NOT turn your back to the harlequin and DO NOT run away. This will trigger the harlequin's chase instinct. You CANNOT outrun a harlequin. Maintain eye-contact and back away. If you're lucky, it should lose interest.</dd>
        <dt>My Clown laid eggs! How do I take care of them?</dt>
        <dd>Clownlings can certainly be a handful! For the first 3 months of life, baby clowns are blind and deaf, and so must rely on their mother for survival. This means a lot of honking! Make sure to provide the mother with extra food and water to help her care for her brood. Clownlings learn to walk and run after about 5 months, and boy are they rowdy! Keep their tent locked up when you're away and supervise their outside play-time. Clownlings can be separated from their mother after 1 year. Contact your local clown shelter to help find new homes for your little ones.</dd>
        <dt>Should I spay/neuter my Clown?</dt>
        <dd>Unless you are a liscensed clown breeder, you should definitely look into getting your clown spayed or neutered. Much like cats and dogs, unexperienced owners often find themselves with a handful of clownlings and have no idea what to do with them. To prevent more stray clowns from roaming the streets, we need to nip the production of excess clownlings in the bud.</dd>
        <dt>Are Clowns really venomous?</dt>
        <dd>Since Clowns rarely bite, only doing so as a last resort, it's not too often that one would need to worry about a Clown's venom. Despite this, each species of Clown is in fact venomous to different degrees. 
            <br>
            <br>
            The venom of Whiteface and Auguste Clowns has a mild sting at worst. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Tramp and Rodeo Clown venom can cause a moderate pain for a minute or two. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Mime venom doesn't hurt too much, but it dramatically slow the victim's movements and reaction time. 
            <br>
            <br>
            The venom from a Creepy Clown causes a rush of adrenaline and increased fear, as well as sharp pain lasting up to 30 minutes. 
            <br>
            <br>
            A Jester's venom can be considered dangerous, as it contains an incredibly painful neurotoxin that can kill a person in large doses. 
            <br>
            <br>
            And lastly the Harlequin's venom, which is the most potent of clown species. Call emergency services immedaitely if bitten by a Harlequin, as brain death will occur within an hour of exposure.</dd>
